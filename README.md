We welcome contributions, but do not actively maintain this library or the compiler plugin.
If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, please contact [@adriaanm](https://github.com/adriaanm).

You may also be interested in https://github.com/scala/async, which covers the most common use case for the continuations plugin.

The Scala Delimited Continuations Plugin and Library will continue to ship with Scala 2.11.0.
However, it will no longer be included with Scala 2.12.
